# Private local pilot

This service-management revision is under qualification. Do not replace an
already running legacy pilot using this controller: legacy owner records fail
closed. Coordinate graceful shutdown with the known launcher, preserve its
Temporal task queue and saved application state, and qualify restart before
installing a persistent service. Native launchd lifecycle tests and migration
acceptance are still required for this revision.

This launcher runs the API, learner/admin static exports, a durable local Temporal
development server and two bounded worker processes on loopback. It is a local
pilot deployment, not a production HA configuration. PostgreSQL must already be
available in a dedicated application database. Native mobile binaries are not used.

Build and verify the repository first. Install a checksum-verified Temporal CLI
in `.local/bin/temporal`. Create `.local/pilot/config.json` with owner-only access:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "publicOrigin": "http://127.0.0.1:4310",
  "databaseUrl": "postgresql:///course_core_dev?host=/tmp",
  "temporalPort": 7239,
  "temporalUiPort": 8239,
  "temporalTaskQueue": "course-core-pilot",
  "serviceToken": "",
  "workspaceIds": [],
  "codeFixtureFiles": []
}
```

Use the API bootstrap CLI against that database to create the owner/workspace and
a one-time sign-in link. Add that workspace ID before enabling its supervisor.
`providerConfigFile` and `providerCredentials` are optional protected local
configuration; never commit them or place keys in the learner export. Provider
capability configuration and an API key are not live acceptance. Shared generation
budgets default to zero and require an authorized administrator configuration.

```sh
node deploy/local/pilot.mjs start
node deploy/local/pilot.mjs status
node deploy/local/pilot.mjs stop
```

Only one launcher owns the state directory. Its owner-only control socket stops
only its own child processes, in order. A failed service stops the group rather
than leaving a half-working pilot. An external service manager may restart the
launcher with backoff; PostgreSQL and Temporal state survive. Status means local
processes were launched and the API answered; it is not a claim of live model
quality, worker progress, provider cost verification or production readiness.

Private course bundles and fixture registries are imported through authenticated
API/host interfaces. They are never added to public web assets or this repository.

`temporalTaskQueue` must retain the queue used by existing persisted workflows.
An existing Temporal database without that explicit setting is rejected. Fresh
installations may omit it; the derived name is stable across restarts. Inspect
existing workflow metadata during a coordinated migration, rather than change a
queue merely because a process is restarted or a release moves directories.

Runtime defaults use two worker activities, a two-second dispatch interval, V8
heap caps of 512 MiB for API, 384 MiB for worker and 128 MiB for dispatcher, plus
a 384 MiB Go memory target and two Go scheduler threads for Temporal. These are
heap/runtime targets, not aggregate RSS limits. Native allocations and PostgreSQL
are additional; measure the actual pilot after migration. Optional `resources`
settings are bounded. Logs retain fixed operational metadata, discard raw child
output, and rotate at 1 MiB with three backups by default.

`node --test deploy/local/runtime.test.mjs` checks private file/socket ownership,
authenticated control, explicit queue migration, constrained environment/resource
settings and simulated launchd registration. Its real child-process start/stop/
restart case uses isolated service fixtures, not the user's running pilot or
a live provider. Actual native service and saved-course restart acceptance remain
separate deployment gates.
